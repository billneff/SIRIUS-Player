SIRIUS Player for Firefox

An addon for Firefox 2.0+ that provides a nicer interface to the Internet
stream provided to SIRIUS subscribers.  This interface is built into the
sidebar in Firefox and allows for Firefox users to easily choose the
channel to listen to, see the playing song's album art, artist/song name,
and an easy link to purchase the track from Amazon.com's non-DRM MP3 store.
